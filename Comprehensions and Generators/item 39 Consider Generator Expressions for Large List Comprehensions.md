# CONSIDER GENERATOR EXPRESSIONS FOR LARGE LIST COMPREHENSIONS 
```text
When to use list comprehension and when to use genrators
```
Program 1: Using List comprehension

about list comprehension
```text
List comprehension produces a list

List comprehension on memory usuage
The entire list is generated and stored in memory immediately.
This can be inefficient for large datasets as it consumes memory
proportional to the size of the list

List comprehension on performance
List comprehension can be faster if you need to repetedly accecss
elements since the entire list is already in memory.

List comprehension on Use Cases
```text
List comprehension is used when you need to generate and work with a list
of items immediately.
Example: Creating a list of numbers or processsing items all at once.

Conclusion:
List comprehension is better for smaller datasets or when you need to repeatedly access items.
```

```python
value = [int(x) for x in open('my_file.txt')]
print(value)
```
output
```text
[100, 57, 15, 1, 12, 75, 5, 86, 89, 11]
```
About Generators
```text
Generalization of List comprehension and generators is called Generators.
The only differece is we we square braces in list where we use small braces in generators.

Generator Output type:
Generator Expression produces a generator object, which is an iterator that generates items on-the-fly.

Generator Expression Memory Usuage:
Generator Expression Generates items one by one as needed
This is more memory-efficient, especially with large datasets, since it only stores one item in memory at a time.

Performance of Generator Expression
It may be slower if you need to iterate multiple times because each item must be recalculated.
However, for single-pass operations, it's generally more efficient.

Use cases of Generator Expression
Generator Expression use when dealing with large data or when you only need to iterate through the sequence once.
Example: Reading large files line by line, processing streaming data, or when you want to chain operations.

Conclusion:
Generator Expression is more suitable for large datasets or when memory efficient is important.
```
Program number 2
```python
it = (int(x) for x in open('my_file.txt'))
print(it)
print(next(it))
```
```text
Took the above iterator and place it into another genrator expression
```
```python
roots = ((x, x**0.5) for x in it)
print(next(roots))
```


Conclusion
```text
- List comprehensions can cause problems for large inputs by using too much memory.
- Generator expressions avoid memory issues by producing outputs one at a time as iterators.
- Generator expressions can be composed by passing the iterator from one generator expression into the for subexpression of another.
- Generator expressions execute very quickly when chained together and are memory efficient.
